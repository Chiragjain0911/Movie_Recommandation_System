# Movie_Recommandation_System

Welcome to my machine learning project repository! As a data science student, I recently completed this project as part of my learning journey.
This project aims to recommand movie in a particular system.
Through this project, I have applied various machine learning techniques and tools to achieve the objectives and gain hands-on experience in data science.
This project is part of my learning journey as a data science student, where I have built a system to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.
The recommendation system utilizes various machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions.
